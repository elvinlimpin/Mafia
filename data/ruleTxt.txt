The Mafia party game presents a 
conflict between the Mafia(the 
informed minority) and the 
Innocents (the uninformed 
majority). The game has two 
phases: "night", when the Mafia
might secretly murder an innocent,
and "day" when Innocents vote
to eliminate a Mafiosi suspect.

The game ends when all the Mafia 
members are eliminated or there 
are more Mafia members than 
Innocents.
